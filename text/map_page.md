Since the project's inception, thousands of MAPS stations have been in operation. Because these stations are volunteer-run, not all of them are run consistently. Here, data is included from 1,264 stations which are operated consistently enough to generate usable data. Station locations are displayed in the map in the top right, and the observed species richness at each is displayed in the bar chart in the bottom right. Explore the stations by using the slider to select a range of elevations.
