This page uses capture data from the MAPS bird banding project to estimate species abundances. Select a species to view the abundance estimates.

**MODEL ASSUMPTIONS:**
- The population must be closed, with no mortality, reproduction, or immigration/emigration within each year's sampling period.
- Each individual bird must have equal likelihood of being caught at any given time.
  - No variation in capture probability based on location.
  - No variation in capture probability based on time.
  - No variation in capture probability based on behavior (trap shyness or trap happiness)
