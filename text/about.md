## Welcome to the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Data Explorer!

#### Why build this app?

This shiny app was built, in part, to provide users a way of exploring physiographic and morphological characteristics of avian populations captured at the Institute for Bird Population's [MAPS](https://www.birdpop.org/pages/maps.php) sites across North America  ...but primarily, it was built as a term project for [ESM 244 (Advanced Data Analysis)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/esm-244) -- this course is taught through the [Master of Environmental Science & Management (MESM) program](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/).

#### What's the data? 

This app is designed to facilitate exploration of data collected as part of the MAPS bird banding project. The MAPS project is a multi-decadal continent-wide effort to monitor bird populations through mark-recapture methods. Birds are captured in mist nets, given a 'bird band' with a unique id number, and various morphometric measurements are taken to assess individuals' species, sex, age, & breeding status. Over time, individual birds are recaptured, allowing estimation of population sizes. The data was downloaded from the [MAPS Data Exploration Tool](https://ibp-maps-data-exploration-tool.org/app/maps).
