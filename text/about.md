## Welcome to the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Data Explorer!

#### Why did I build this app?

This shiny app was built, in part, to provide users a way of exploring physiographic and morphological characteristics of avian populations captured at the Institute for Bird Population's [MAPS](https://www.birdpop.org/pages/maps.php) sites in Washington state  ...but primarily, it was built as a term project for [ESM 244 (Advanced Data Analysis)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/esm-244) -- this course is taught through the [Master of Environmental Science & Management (MESM) program](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/).
